Like you, I have heard from many people that if you drop a few Mentos into a bottle of soda, a violent soda eruption will occur.  I decided that I needed to try this myself.  Foreseeing the difficulty of attempting to do this single-handedly, I recruited Chris, Sean, and Caspar to assist me in my noble quest.  After procuring the necessary supplies, we performed our experiment in the street in front of Casparâ€™s house.  This is a picture of the result.
