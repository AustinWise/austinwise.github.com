From time to time, people ask me "please give me an exhistive list of podcasts you are currently listening to". To avoid further incidents of human interaction, I present to you my recommendations of podcasts to listen to.

NOTE: make intro less obviously anti-social

## Tech Podcasts

Programming and computing in genral are my hobbey and profession, so I listen to a number of podcasts to keep up with the industry.

* Merge Conflict: this podcast had a .NET and mobile focus. The magic of it is the chemistry between the two hosts.
* Security Now: while this podcast is security focused, the pervasive impact on security topics in the broader industry means this podcast punches above its weight in relevence. Beyond that, from time to time the podcast covers fundamentals in computers beyond security.
