<p>In march I dropped <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> and switched to <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">µTorrent</a> after a friend told me about it.  This first big differencee I noticed was its tiny memory use.  Instead of using Azureus's 60MB, it used 6MB.  This is important on my memory-cramped server, becausee I also run IIS, SQL, DNS and file servers.  Another useful feature is the podcast downloader, a feature which Azuereus is lacking (yes, I know about the various podcast downloadextensionss for Azuerus, but none of the have all the features I need).  Interestingly, several cool are also now using µTorrent: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060822070947/http://www.intellectualhedonism.com/2006/03/22/AzureusOutUTorrentIn.aspx">Carl Franklin</a>, <a href="http://www.campbellassociates.ca/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8de4dae8-80b7-4abe-870a-74fb90f8211f">Richard Campbell</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061108012032/http://www.nukeation.net/PermaLink,guid,368d62eb-4f28-4bc0-8b63-89069b306e70.aspx">Dax Pandhi</a>.</p>
