<p>
I just downloaded and installed Flock 0.4.9. Based on the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> browser, Flock at integration with bookmarking (<a href="https://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>), Bloging (I am writing this in Flock), and photos (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>). I have heard people say that the Flock's team should spend their time creating extensions for Firefox rather than creating a whole new browser, but it is nice to have everything in one package. For example, before now I have not used del.icio.us before, but now that it's in the browser, I use it.
