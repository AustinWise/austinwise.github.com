The .NET CoreCLR .

## Overall Architecture

test `img` 3

TODO: title idea: interface bounderies in coreclr 
TODO: title idea: .net coreclr architecture: internal implementation details
TODO: title idea: components of coreclr

The a simplified view of the .NET runtime is it contains 3 main components: the garbage collector, the
just-in-time compiler (JIT), and the execution engine:

! TODO: cool diagram of the three main components of the .NET runtime.

There are well-factored interfaces at the boundaries between these components.

! TODO: links to interfaces

! TODO: find all interesting interface boundeties in coreclr. The ones that allow compoents to live in differet DLLs are easy to find. maybe there are intereting interfaces within a DLL?

## GC

The GC receives allocation requests from the EE and returns memory. The EE's finializer thread asks
the GC for what objects are ready to finialize so that the EE can run the finializer.

The .NET GC is a
[tracing garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection), so
periodically it has to ask the EE what objects are alive on the stacks of threads and in static
variables. This enables the GC to figure out what objects are alive and which can be collected.


## JIT

## fcall and qcall

## profiler api

## debugger api

## hosting api?

I have personally deleted chuncks of this from CoreCLR. Not repevant to modern .NET.

## Native AOT

TODO: explain how the module design enables interesting remixes like NativeAOT, Crossgen, and SuperPMI.
