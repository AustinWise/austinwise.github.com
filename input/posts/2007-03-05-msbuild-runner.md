Have you ever wanted to quickly compile a Visual Studio solution or project without opening Visual Studio?  Well, now you can!
I have been using my <a href="https://www.codeplex.com/msbuildrunner/">MSBuild Runner</a> tool for some time now, and I find it pretty helpful.  It sports Windows Explorer integration and supports building for any version of the .NET Framework that comes with MSBuild (currently 2.0 and the 3.5 CTP come with a version of MSBuild).  Feel free to send me suggestions and feedback at the CodePlex site.
