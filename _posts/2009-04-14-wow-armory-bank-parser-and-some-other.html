I made several programs while playing world of warcraft.  He's three of them.

<h4>Bank Parser</h4>
While I was playing the World of Warcraft with my friends, we formed a guild.  We used the guild vault to pool resources in a sort of communist style system.  My guild leader wanted to ensure that everyone was being generally fair with their contribution and usage of resource.  So I endeavored to write a program to analyze the guild bank log from <a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/">wowarmory.com</a>.

Getting at the data is not too hard, as the whole website is sent as XML and then transformed in the browser with XSLT.  I wrote one program to download the XML pages and load and display them.  The code can be found <a href="http://github.com/AustinWise/wow-armory-bank-log-parser/">on Github</a>.

I'm not posting a binary because this project has not been updated since Blizzard switched to using Battle.net accounts for log-in.  So currently it does not work, but it should not be too much trouble to update it.

<h4>Flying Mount Macro</h4>
While this is by definition less than 255 characters, that is why it was so difficult to make.


<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<code>
/run m={1,34,35,40};z=GetZoneText();if IsFlyableArea() and(((z~="Dalaran")or(GetSubZoneText() =="Krasus' Landing"))and(z~="Wintergrasp"))then m={11,26};end 
/run CallCompanion("MOUNT",m[math.random(1, #m)]);
</code>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

It will randomly select a ground mount while in old world, dalaran (but not Krasus' Landing), or wintergrasp.  While in any other part of northrend or out land, it will select a random flying mount.  It is kinda cumbersome to use, as the mounts are specified by their position in the mounts window.  The first m= is ground mounts will the second is flying mounts.  This only has to be updated every time you get a new mount ;-).

I know there are addons such as Mounted that give you a nice UI and don't break every time a new mount is added, but I found my macro to be more reliable once I got it working.

<h4>Wowhead downloader and scanner</h4>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com">Wowhead.com</a> has a ton of useful information on it.  For certain tasks it can be handy to have a copy of their website on your hard drive.  For example, the bank parser could be augmented to see if any materials lying around could be crafted into an item.

Pointing a conventional web spider at wowhead does not work because of the site's intense usage of javascript.  However I noticed that the javascript used to define links to other pages was not too far from being JSON (duh, since JSON is just a subset of javascript).  For all the details see the code <a href="https://github.com/AustinWise/ndxwowhead/tree">on Github</a>.
