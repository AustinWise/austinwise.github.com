<p>I just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock 0.4.9</a>. Based on the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> browser, Flock at integration with bookmarking (<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>), Bloging (I am writing this in Flock), and photos (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>). I have heard people say that the Flock's team should spend their time creating extensions for Firefox rather than creating a whole new browser, but it is nice to have everything in one package.
