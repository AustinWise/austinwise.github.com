You know that really anoying behavior that Windows Xp SP2 added where downloads warn when you try to open them?  The one that brings up the dialog titled "Open File - Security Warning" with the message "Do you want to run this file"?  For some reason the Mozilla guys <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236771">thought it would be a good idea</a> to add this "feature" it to Firefox 3.

Fortunately it's not too hard to disable the Attachment Execution Service behind this.  According to the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260">Microsft article about the service</a>, you can disable the service by:
<ol>
<li>Opening <code>regedit.exe</code>.</li>
<li>Navigating to <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments</code>.</li>
<li>Create (or set) the DWORD value <code>SaveZoneInformation</code> to <code>1</code>.</li>
</ol>

This post is mostly for my future reference, but I hope you find it useful too.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/18060096-5401918526381357708?l=www.awise.us' alt='' /></div>
